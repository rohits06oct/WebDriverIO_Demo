### Usage
This should be added to your `package.json`, as follows:

Note: Default paths will be used, and can be configured in `vars.js`.
The options `-i` and `-o` can be used to temporarily overwrite those values.

```
"scripts": {
    ...
    "test": "wdio && wdio-junit-to-html -i <INPUT_DIRECTORY> -o <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>",
    ...
},
```

## Options
`-i, --input <input>` The input folder path (relative)

`-o, --output <output_directory>` The output folder path (relative)

`-s, --single` Export all reports as one file.

`-l, --log` Log basic information about what is being done.

`-e, --email_report` Will send an email of the report using configured information found within `vars.js` file.  (Emailing only works when the `-s, --single` option is used, as of now.)
